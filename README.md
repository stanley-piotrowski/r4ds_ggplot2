# README

This repository contains all scripts and figures as I worked through 
Wickham, Navarro, and Pedersen's [ggplot2: elegant graphics for data 
analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) (third edition) as part of 
the R 4 Data Science ggplot2 book club 
(club website, code, and meeting recordings can be found 
[here](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-ggplot2/).
